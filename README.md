# Gload RsiStoch

This code is a trading algorithm that calculates the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Stoch (Stochastic Oscillator) indicators based on provided data. It identifies intersection points between the RSI and Stoch indicators and implements risk management techniques.

## Input Parameters

- RSI_period: The period for calculating the RSI indicator (default: 14)
- Stoch_K_period: The period for calculating the Stoch K line (default: 14)
- Stoch_D_period: The period for calculating the Stoch D line (default: 3)

## Variables

- RSI_buffer: An array to store the calculated RSI values
- Stoch_K_buffer: An array to store the calculated Stoch K values
- Stoch_D_buffer: An array to store the calculated Stoch D values

## CalculateIndicators()

This function calculates the RSI and Stoch indicators based on the input parameters. It loops through the historical bars and calculates the RSI and Stoch values for each bar. The calculated values are stored in the respective buffers.

## IdentifyIntersectionPoints()

This function identifies the intersection points between the RSI and Stoch indicators. It loops through the historical bars and checks if the RSI crosses above or below the Stoch K line. If an intersection point is found, a buy or sell signal is generated.

## RiskManagement()

This function implements risk management techniques such as setting stop-loss and take-profit levels. The code provided in this function is just an example, and you can modify it according to your own risk management strategy.

## OnTick()

This is the main function that is executed on every tick. It calls the CalculateIndicators(), IdentifyIntersectionPoints(), and RiskManagement() functions in sequence.

## Product Description
